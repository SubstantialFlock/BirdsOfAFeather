# BirdsOfAFeather

You have questions about the food you buy, but no easy way to assess if your purchase should raise a concern. We like to think wholistically, and say “Healthy for you, Healthy for the Planet”. What are your personal concerns? Be it allergies, artificial ingredients, societal issues, or the environment. Answer a few initial questions and have a personalized tool that easily identifies products that fit with your unique lifestyle.
